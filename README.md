# go-nx

A Go package for parsing and programmatically working with files with the [NX/PKG4 format](http://nxformat.github.io/).

The `go-nx` library's design was inspired by Diamondo25's [node-nx-parser (Node)](https://github.com/diamondo25/node-nx-parser) and Strax's [nx-pkg4 (Java)](https://github.com/strax/nx-pkg4) NX parsing library.


## Installation

The `go-nx` package is comprised of a library and a runnable binary, `tools/main.go` in this repo.

To install the library:

	$ go get github.com/MrSaints/go-nx
